# Phone Number Generator (Test Data Tool)

This project provides sample phone numbers formatted according to international numbering standards.

Developers often need realistic phone numbers for:

* form validation
* UI testing
* API development
* demo data
* documentation examples

Using real phone numbers during testing can cause privacy issues and accidental SMS delivery.
